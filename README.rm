Singing Stallman 0.9
by Myles V. Barros

Singing Stallman is a simple Firefox extension that cleanses its users of their
closed-source urges and exorcises their proprietary sins through Richard
Stallman's Free Software Song. The add-on also offers several covers of the FSS.

## Background ##

Information about the FSS, including lyrics and a must-read history, are
available from the Free Software Foundation:
   
   https://www.gnu.org/music/free-software-song.html

A video of Stallman performing the FSS is available on YouTube:

## Requirements ##

Singing Stallman 0.9 is compatible with  Firefox 29 and later.

It is not developed for Thunderbird and any functionality that it may or may
not provide is accidental and unintended.

## Installation ##

As Singing Stallman has not yet been released through Firefox's official
Add-On venue, it's necessary to build the extension in order to install it.
Fortunately, doing so is not terribly difficult.

Step One
Download and install the Firefox Add-On SDK, available through the Dev portal:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation

Step Two
Clone the Mercurial repository from Sourceforge

Step Three
cd into the project directory and run the following command:
    cfx xpi
This will output a file called "singingstallman.xpi" in the project directory,
which is great, because that's our extension.

The add-on can be installed by opening up the Firefox Add-Ons page either
through the Tools menu or by typing "about:addons" into the URL bar and
dragging the included xpi file to the Extensions section.

The add-on will be distributed through Mozilla's official Firefox distribution
portal once it reaches version 1.0. So look out for that!
