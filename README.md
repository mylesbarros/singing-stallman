# Singing Stallman

A Firefox add-on to give you uninterupted access to Richard Stallman's Free Software Song at all hours of the day and in every circumstance.

While participating in a "bardic circle" at a Science Fiction convention that he was attending in 1991, Stallman would pen one of the most important documents in Computer Science history: the Free Software Song. Set to the beat of a Bulgarian folk song, the FSS has the power to cleanse you of the influence of those filthy, closed-source licenses and inspire all those within ear shot to devote themselves thoroughly and totally to the open source software initiative.

Through the use of the Singing Stallman extension you can invoke that power through the mere click of a button. The only question is, can you handle it?

In addition to a performance by Stallman's own mouth, Singing Stallman feature another seven covers and remixes.

## Background

Information about the FSS, including lyrics and a must-read history, are
available from the Free Software Foundation:

A video of Stallman performing the FSS is available on YouTube:

## Installation

The add-on is available for download through the Firefox Add-Ons portal:

    https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/singing-stallman/

Alternatively you could build the extension yourself and install it. Though I don't know why you would.
